# Lab 1: Hello World 🌍

Welcome to your first Python lab!

In this lab, you will:
- Learn how to edit files directly on GitHub.
- Make your first commit.
- Run a simple Python program using **GitHub Codespaces**

---

## Instructions

1. **Open the `hello.py` file** in your repository.  
   - Click the pencil ✏️ button in the top-right corner to edit it.

2. **Modify the program**:  
   - Change it to print your name (add a print statement to the code to print your name).  
   - Add one more print statement about your favorite hobby.  

3. **Commit your changes**:  
   - Click **Commit changes**. 
   - Note: The **Commit changes** button is the green button in the top-right corner.
  
## How to Run Your Code in GitHub Codespaces  

### Step 1 — Open your repository  
- Go to your assignment repository page on GitHub.  

---

### Step 2 — Start a Codespace  
1. At the top right, click the **green “Code” button**.  
2. In the dropdown menu, click **Codespaces**.  
3. Select **“Create codespace on main”** (or “New codespace”).  
   - 🔄 This may take 1–2 minutes the first time — GitHub is setting up your environment.  

---

### Step 3 — See the VS Code editor in your browser  
- A new tab will open.  
- You’ll see a window that looks like **Visual Studio Code** with a file tree on the left (your repository).  

---

### Step 4 — Open the terminal  
- Look at the bottom of the screen. You should see a **panel with a terminal**.  
- If you don’t see it:  
  - Click the **Menu bar → Terminal → New Terminal**.  
  - A terminal will open at the bottom of the Codespace window.

### Step 5 — Run your Python program  
In the terminal, type:  
```bash
python hello.py
